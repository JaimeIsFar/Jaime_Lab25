	Abstract = {An extension of signal detection theory (SDT) that incorporates mixtures of the underlying distributions is presented. The mixtures can be motivated by the idea that a presentation fo a signal shifts the location of anunderlying distribution only if the observer is attending to the signal; otherwise, the distribution is not shifted or is only partially shifted. Thus, trials with a signal presentation consist of a mixture of 2 (or more) latent classes of trials. Mixture SDT provides a general theoretical framework that offers a new perspective on a number of findings. For example, mixture SDT offers an alternative to the unequal variance signal detection model; it can also account for nonlinear normal receiver operating characteristic curves, as found in recent research.},

	Abstract = {The mirror effect for word frequency refers to the finding that low-frequency words have higher hit rates and lower false alarm rates that high-frequency words. This result is typically interpreted in terms of conventional signa detection theory (SDT), in which case it indicates that the order of the underlying old item distributions mirrors the order of the new item distributions. However, when viewed in terms of a mixture revision of SDT, the order of hits and false alarms does not neccesarily imply the same order in the underlying distributions because of possible effects of mixing. A reversal in underlying distributions did not appear for fits of mixture SDT models to data from 4 experiments. },

	Abstract = {Three regularities in recognitionmemory are described with supporting data: the mirror effect, the order of receiver operating characteristic slopes, and the symmetry of movement of underlying distributions. The derivation of these regularities from attention/likelihood theory is demosntrated. The theory's central concept, which distinguishes it from other theories, is the following: Ss make recognition decisions by combining information about new and old items, the combination made in the form of likelihood ratios. The central role of the likelihood rations extends the implications of signal detection theory for recognition memory. Attention/likelihood theory is fitted to data of 2 series of experiments. One series involves yes-no tests and confidence ratings, the other forced-choice experiments. It is argued that the regularities require a revision of most current theories of recognition memory},

@article{Hilford2015,
	Abstract = {A basic assumption of Signal Detection Theory is that decisions are made on the basis of likelihood ratios. In a preceding paper, Glanzer, Hilfor, and Maloney /psychonomic Bulletin & Review, 16, 431-455, 2009) showed that the likelihood ratio assumption implies that three regularities will occur in recognition memory: (1) the Mirror Effect, (2) the Variance Effect, (3) the normalized Receiver Operating Characteristic (z-ROC) Length Effect. The paper offered formal proofs and computational demosntrations that decisions based on likelihood ratios produce the three regularities. A survey of data ased on group ROCs from 36 studies validated the likelihood ratio assumption by showing that its three implied regularities are ubiquituous. The study noted, however, that bias, another basis factor in Signal Detection Theory, can obscure the Mirror Effect. In this paper we examine how bias affects the regularities at the theoretical leve. The theoretical analysis shows: (1) how bias obscures the Mirror Effect, not the other two reguarities, and (2) four ways to counter that obscuring. We then report the results of five experiments that support the theoretical analysis. The analyses and the experimental results also demonstrate: (1) that the three regularities govern individual, as well as group, performance, (2) alternative explanations of the regularities are ruled oyt, and (3) tat Signal Detection Theory, correctly applied, gives a simple and unified explanation of recognition memory data.},

Pollack and Norman (1964) answered this question affirmatively for sensitivity, Hodos (1970) for bias: Both proposed measures based on triangular areas in receiver-operating characteristic space. Their papers, and especially a paper by Grier (1971) that provided computing formulas for the measures, continue to be heavily cited in a wide range of content areas. In our sample of articles, most authors described triangle-based measures as making fewer assumptions than measures associated with detection theory. However, we show that statistics based on products or ratios of right triangle areas, including recently proposed bias index and not-yet-proposed but apparently plausible sensitivity index, are consistent with a decision process based on logistic distributions. Even the Pollack and Norman measure, which is based on non-right triangles, is approximately logistic for low values of sensitivity. Simple geometric models for sensitivity and bias are not nonparametric, even if their implications are not acknowledged in the defining publications},

The nteractions of wavelngth discrimination and reinforcement (Boneau, Holland and Baker, 1965) have been examined within a detection-theory framework (Nevin,1965), and a full-blown decision theory of animal discrimination performance has been published (Bonea and Cole, 1967). Blough (1967) has used signal-detection analysis to present wavelength generalization gradients in a novel way, and Rilling and Mc Diarmid (1969) and Stubbs (1968) have extended this analysis to the study of response-produced and temporal stimuli. Most recently, Blough (1969) has considered signal detection theory as an alternative to traditional formulatios of stimulus generalization. A knowledge of signal detection theory is therefore important for its relevance to perant research as well as for its central position in sensory psychology.},

@article{Rouder2005,
	Abstract = {Although many nonlinear models of cognition have been proposed in the past 50 years, there has been little consideration of corresponding statistical techniques for their analysis. In analyses with nonlinear models, unmodeled variability from the selection of items or participants may lead to asymptotically biased estimation. This asymptotic bias, in turn, renders inference problematic. We show, for example, that a signal detection analysis of recognition memory data leads to asymptotic underestimation of sensitivity. To eliminate asymptotic bias, we advocate hierarchical models in which participant variaility, item bariability and measurement error are modeled simultaneously. By accounting for multiple sources of variability, hierarchical models yield consistent and accurate estimates of participant and item effects in recognition memory. This article is written in tutorial format; we rovide an introduction to Bayesian statistics, hierarchical modeling and Markov chain Monte Carlo computational techniques.},

	Abstract = {The juxtaposition of established signal detection theory models of perception and more recent claims about the encoding of uncertainty in perception is a rich source of confusion. Are the latter simpy a rehash of the former? Here, we make ana ttempt to distinguish precisely between optimal and probabilistic computation. In optimal computation, the observer minimizes the expected cost under a posterior probability distribution. In probabilistic computation, the observer uses higher moments of the likelihood functon of the stimulus on a tria-by-trial basis. Computation can be optimal without being probabilistic and vice-versa. Most signal detection theory models describe optimal computation. Behavioral data only provide evidence for a neural representation of uncertaity if they are best described by a model of probabilistic computation. We argue that single-neuron activity sometimes suffices for optimal computation, but never for probabilistic computation. A population code is needed instead. Not every population code is equally suitable, because nusance parameters have to be marginalized out. This problem is solved by Poisson-like, but not by Gaussian bariability. Finally we build a dictionary between signal detection theory quantities and Poisson.like population quantities.},

	Abstract = {Two influential models of recognition memory, the unequal variance signal-detection model and a dual-process threshold/detection model accurately describe the receiver operating characteristic, but only the latter model can provide estimates of recollection and familiarity. Such estimates often accord with those provided by the remember-know procedure, and both methods are now widely used in the neuroscience literature to identify the brain correlates of recollection and familiarity. However, in recent years, a substantial literature has accumulated directly contrasting the signal-detection model against the threshold/Detection-model, and that litrature is almost unanimous in its endorsement of signal detection theory. A dual process version of signal detection theory implies that individual recgnition decisions are not process pure, and it suggest new ways to investigate the brain correlates of recognition memory.},
